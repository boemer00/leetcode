# LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, specifically those covered in the Data Structures and Algorithms course provided by NeetCode.

## Structure

- Each solution is organised by problem type (e.g., arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming) in its respective Jupyter Notebook.
- Solutions are written in Python and some include a brief explanation in comments within the code.
- Some solutions may also include additional notes on time and space complexity (Big O notation).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code to understand different approaches to solving common algorithmic problems. Clone the repository and run the Python files to test the solutions on your own machine.

## Updates

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue the course.
